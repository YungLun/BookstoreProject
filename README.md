#Overview:
The Bookstore Management System is designed to handle all core operations for a small-to-medium retail bookstoreI.
Its goal is to maintain accurate inventory, track suppliers and purchases, manage sales transactions, and keep customer information securely.
Everything revolves around books as the main product and connects suppliers (who provide them) to customers (who buy them) through orders, sales, and stock management.

#Problem Domain:
Traditional bookstores often maintain inventory and supplier data manually, leading to:
1.Inconsistent stock information and delayed restocking
2.Duplicate or incomplete order records
3.Poor coordination between sales, purchasing, and suppliers
Bookstore Management System can do:
1.Centralizing all operational data into one relational schema
2.Enforcing referential integrity through foreign keys
3.Automating updates using triggers and stored procedures
4.Enabling secure, role-based access for different staff groups
5.Maintain accurate book and supplier records  
6.Track inventory and automatically trigger restocking  
7.Manage customer orders and payments
